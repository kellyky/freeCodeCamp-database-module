Here you'll find mostly exercises from the freeCodeCamp Relational Database course (currently in beta, but it's awesome and there's a lot of bash). 

I'm really enjoying the bash exercises - examples are bingo.sh, countdown.sh, fortune.sh, and questionnaire.sh. These inspired me to rewrite a text-baesd adventure game I'd previously coded in Python: [text-adventure.py](https://github.com/kellyky/Adventure-Game-Python/blob/master/text-adventure.py). I changing up the villains and weapons a bit but otherwise used the same plot. 

**Setup to Play**: download, clone, or copy text-adventure.sh. Navigate in your terminal to the directory it's in, and give it executable permissions: `chmod +x text-adventure.sh`. 

**To Play**: from that same directory run it: `./text-adventure.sh`, follow the prompts, and make your decisions. Enjoy! 

Setup and play is the same for the .sh files in `tutorial-stuff`. but they're not really games. ðŸ¤”
